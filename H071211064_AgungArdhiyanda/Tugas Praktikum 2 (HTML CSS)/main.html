                        concentrations in aerospace products—including aircraft, space launchers, satellites, and
                        defense systems—and other advanced-technology systems and services. About half of the company’s
                        annual sales are to the U.S. Department of Defense. Lockheed Martin is also a leading contractor
                        for the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
                        It was formed in 1995 through the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta
                        Corporation, the second and third largest American defense contractors at the time. In 1996 the
                        new company grew further with the acquisition of Loral Corporation’s defense electronics and
                        systems (itself comprising nine separate aerospace and defense units of major American
                        corporations such as IBM, Xerox, and Ford). Headquarters are in Bethesda, Maryland.

                    <p>The B-1 was designed to penetrate radar-guided air defenses by flying at low levels. It was built
                        in two versions by Rockwell International. The B-1A, first flown in 1974, was designed to reach
                        twice the speed of sound at high altitudes and to carry nuclear bombs and short-range attack
                        missiles (SRAMs).</p>
